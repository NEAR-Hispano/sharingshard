You are involved in solving problems while creating new ventures, developing projects, or providing services. While you do your work every day, you face challenges that require getting knowledge and experience from people in the industry.
 
SharingShard helps you share scenarios, situations, and problems you find on YouTube videos while looking for a solution. The goal of SharingShard is to find the help you need by sharing a video that shows the problem you want to solve. 
 
Commonly, specific scenarios for the problem you are looking how to find a solution are a short part of long videos. By sharing the moment you discover in the video with an open community, you can ask for specific advice, help, or a complete solution.

An experience consists of finding a moment in a video by marking the scene that provides the reference to look for points of view. This scene happens in time within the video, where you have a reference to the context that helps people understand the problem to be solved.
 
People will provide points of view focusing on how to solve the challenge shown at the moment.
 
Each moment has assigned a reward for the best Point of View allocated by the creator of the experience.
 
## Collaborate with your Points of View
Each experience is open to receiving one point of view from each community member. The Points of View are open to everybody to share ideas and provide a better understanding of the problem, enhance the current solution, and more.
