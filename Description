What is a Knooget?

It is a knowledge capsule that allows sharing information, connecting with people, and provoking a learning experience that holds a value enhanced by people's interaction to nurture the knowledge embedded in the capsule.

Digital videos hold a tremendous amount of information. The knowledge available within each video is hidden in small segments that the viewer needs to discover to dig into concepts, get an idea, find an opportunity, to learn about a subject.

Within each video, you can find a lot of moments that trigger your interest to explore the specific information that maybe is only a few seconds or a small segment of the video. You need to register these moments to explore the information contained.

SharingShard provides the capability to explore each moment. First, you register the moment in the video and write a note to identify what you found in that segment, known as a moment.
